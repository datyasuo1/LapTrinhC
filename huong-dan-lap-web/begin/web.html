                <p class="mb-0">Before learning Kenbunshoku Haki, Luffy can easily dodge most of the powerful attacks of opponents like Enel or Rob Lucci with just his intuition and instincts. During his childhood, Luffy also seemed to be very adept at using a pole, as he used it against various opponents. He is also smart enough to understand at least basic concepts, such as the fact that rubber is a natural insulator, which is why he does not even dodge at all of his super-strong electric strike lines. Enel, so dodging would be a good deal since your body was immune to his aura. He has also developed new moves like "Gear Second" ("Shift 2") or "Gear Third" ("Gear Third"), "Gear four" ("tank man", "snake man"). manipulate logical inferences by understanding the properties of a rubber. </p>
